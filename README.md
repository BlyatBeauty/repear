This fork of RePear is identical to the original, just bundled with the .NET Framework DLL files needed to run the executable version on Windows.

================================================================================================

rePear is a tool that allows using an Apple iPod audio player without iTunes. The user can manage the audio files on the iPod with a normal file manager and rePear takes care that they can be played on the device.

To use these sources, one needs Python. repear is known to work with Python 2.5 and 2.6. Using py2exe, one could easily create a Windows executable such as the one the repear Sourceforge page offers. However, because those sources are not supplied with the original repear package, they will be missing from this repository until such a time that they are.
